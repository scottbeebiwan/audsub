# what is this?

my first c program.

it plays subtitles to audio.

# why?

i had to come up with something to do

# the subtitle """format"""
[ ms in audio ] text

the text can contain a \, which affects the output

\r: return

\n: newline

\\: backslash

\E: exit, end. anything afterward never gets printed

\~[frequency],[until]}:

repeat everything before it at the frequency (ms between repeats),

until until.

ignores everything after it.
